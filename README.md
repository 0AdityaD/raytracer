Haskell Path Tracer
===================

## Requirements

This project requires [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) to
build. Most Linux distros will come with a stack package in their repos--on
Windows and MacOS systems, you can use the [Haskell
Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) to obtain Stack.

On UTCS linux machines, Stack can be installed using the bundled 
`install-stack-utcs.sh` shell script. This script will, by default, place
the executable at `$HOME/.local/bin/stack`. Alternate paths can be
specified with the `-d` flag.
