Haskell Ray Tracer
===================

## Requirements

This project requires [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) to
build. Most Linux distros will come with a stack package in their repos--on
Windows and MacOS systems, you can use the [Haskell
Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) to obtain Stack.
